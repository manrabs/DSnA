# LEETCODE 36
# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

# Note:
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: board = 
# [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: board = 
# [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: false

# Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
 
# Constraints:
# board.length == 9
# board[i].length == 9
# board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
